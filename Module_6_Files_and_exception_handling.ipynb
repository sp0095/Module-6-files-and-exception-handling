        "\n",
        "**1. Garbage Collection Overhead**\n",
        "Performance Impact: The garbage collector periodically checks for unused objects and reclaims memory. This can introduce performance overhead, especially in applications with a large number of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuning: While Python provides ways to tune the garbage collector (e.g., gc.set_threshold()), finding the right balance between memory usage and performance can be challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Cyclic References**\n",
        "Detection and Collection: Cyclic references (objects that reference each other) are not immediately collected by reference counting alone. The cyclic garbage collector must identify and handle these cycles, which can be resource-intensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Programming Discipline: Developers need to be mindful of creating cyclic references and use weak references (weakref module) when appropriate to mitigate this issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Memory Leaks**\n",
        "Undetected Memory Leaks: Memory leaks can still occur if objects are unintentionally kept alive due to lingering references. Detecting and resolving these leaks can be difficult.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tooling: Using tools like objgraph and tracemalloc can help identify memory leaks, but it requires additional effort and expertise.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Fragmentation**\n",
        "Heap Fragmentation: Frequent allocation and deallocation of small objects can lead to memory fragmentation, where free memory is divided into small, non-contiguous blocks. This can degrade performance over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Optimization: Python's memory allocator (pymalloc) is designed to mitigate fragmentation, but developers need to be aware of how their memory usage patterns can impact it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Large Object Handling**\n",
        "Memory Consumption: Handling large objects (e.g., large lists, dictionaries, or arrays) can consume significant memory. Managing memory efficiently for such objects requires careful planning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Structures: Choosing the right data structures and algorithms can help minimize memory usage, but it requires a good understanding of their trade-offs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**\n",
        "Concurrency Limitations: The GIL limits the execution of multiple threads in CPython, impacting the performance of multi-threaded applications, especially those that are CPU-bound.\n",
